This is a simple plugin for the addon [Bagnon](https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/bagnon) that shows the item level of your equipable gear and artifact relics. It has no dependencies and works straight out of the box. 

This addon is compatible with Bagnon for WoW 3.3.5a - 7.3.0.

## How to install
If you're familiar with git, simply clone the repository to a folder named **Bagnon_ItemLevel** inside your World of Warcraft addons folder.

If not, and you need to do this manually, then download and unzip it to your `World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns\` directory. Rename the folder from **Bagnon_ItemLevel-master** to just **Bagnon_ItemLevel**, or the game won't find it. 

Also, make sure the game is closed when moving new files into the addon directory as it is unable to discover new files when it's already running. And remember to check the "load out of date addons" checkbox in the addon listing on the character selection screen, or the game won't load the addon. The latter should not be a problem in Legion as the addon is always labeled with the most recent version it supports, but for game clients running older versions of WoW, it is vital to check this box to load the addon!

## Buy me a beer
Making addons and full UIs like mine takes a lot of time and effort, as they're all one-man projects. I do it because I love doing it, because I believe it makes the game better and more enjoyable. But still, a lot of hours are put into it.

Donations are in no way required, since my addons always has been and always will be free and fully available to everybody without restrictions. But if you truly wish to support my hard work, even the smallest contribution goes a long way! Because nothing is quite as motivating as beer money!
