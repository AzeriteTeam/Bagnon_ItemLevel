This is a simple plugin for the addon [Bagnon](https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/bagnon) that shows the item level of your equipable gear and artifact relics. It has no dependencies and works straight out of the box. 

This addon is compatible with Bagnon for WoW 3.3.5a - 7.3.0.

## How to install
If you're familiar with git, simply clone the repository to a folder named **Bagnon_ItemLevel** inside your World of Warcraft addons folder. If not, and you need to do this manually, then download and unzip it to your `World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns\` directory. Rename the folder from **Bagnon_ItemLevel-master** to just **Bagnon_ItemLevel**, or the game won't find it. Also, make sure the game is closed when moving new files into the addon directory as it is unable to discover new files when it's already running.
